							advertising, search
							engine technology, cloud computing, computer software, quantum computing, e-commerce, and consumer
							electronics. It has
							been referred to as "the most powerful company in the world"[10] and as one of the world's most valuable
							brands due to
							its market dominance, data collection, and technological advantages in the field of artificial
							intelligence.[11][12][13]
							Alongside Amazon, Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, and Microsoft, Google's parent company Alphabet Inc. is one
							of the five
							Big Tech companies.</p>
						<p>Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by American computer scientists Larry Page and Sergey Brin while
							they were PhD students at Stanford University in California. Together they own about 14% of its publicly
							listed shares
							and
							control 56% of its stockholder voting power through super-voting stock. The company went public via an
							initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of
							Alphabet Inc.
							<mark>Google</mark> is Alphabet's largest <br>
							ubsidiary and is a holding company for Alphabet's internet properties and interests. Sundar Pichai was
							appointed CEO of
							Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019,

						<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/" class="">Youtube</a> is an American online video
							sharing
							and social media platform headquartered in San Bruno, California, United
							States. Accessible worldwide,[7] it was launched on February 14, 2005, by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and
							Jawed
							Karim. It
							is owned by Google and is the second most visited website, after Google Search. YouTube has more than 2.5
							billion
							monthly users,[8] who collectively watch more than one billion hours of videos each day.[9] As of May
							2019,
							videos were
							being uploaded at a rate of more than 500 hours of content per minute.[10][11]</p>
						<p>In October 2006, YouTube was bought by Google for $1.65 billion.[12] Google's ownership of YouTube
							expanded
							the site's
							business model, expanding from generating revenue from advertisements alone to offering paid content such
							as
							movies and
							exclusive content produced by YouTube. It also offers YouTube Premium, a paid subscription option for
							watching content
							without ads. YouTube also approved creators to participate in Google's AdSense program, which seeks to
							generate more
							revenue for both parties. In 2021, YouTube's annual advertising revenue increased to $28.8 billion, an
							increase in
							revenue of 9 billion from the previous year.[1] YouTube reported revenue of $29.2 billion in 2022.
